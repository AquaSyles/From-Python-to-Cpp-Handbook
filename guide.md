# C++ Quick Overview

C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language widely used for system software, game development, and more. Here's a brief overview:

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented:** Supports object-oriented programming principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- **High Performance:** Offers low-level memory manipulation and efficient execution, making it suitable for resource-intensive tasks.

- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Includes a collection of reusable libraries for common data structures and algorithms.

- **Multi-paradigm:** Supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms.

## Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, C++!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
