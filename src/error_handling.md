# 7. Error Handling

Error handling in C++ differs significantly from Python, especially considering C++ lacks built-in exception support. As a beginner transitioning from Python, understanding the methods of error handling in C++ is crucial for writing robust and reliable code.

## 7.1 No Built-in Exceptions

Unlike Python, C++ does not have built-in exception handling using keywords like `try`, `except`, and `finally`. Instead, error handling in C++ often involves alternative approaches.

## 7.2 Return Codes and Statements

One common method is using return codes or statements to indicate the success or failure of a function. A function can return a specific value, usually an integer, to signal whether the operation was successful or encountered an error.

Example:
```cpp
int divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        // Return an error code
        return -1;
    }
    return a / b;
}
```
In this example, the function divide returns -1 if the divisor b is zero, indicating a potential division by zero error.

## 7.3 Debugging Techniques
For beginners, debugging tools become invaluable for identifying and fixing errors in C++ code. Utilize Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion, which offer powerful debugging features.

**Using a Debugger:**
- Set Breakpoints: Place breakpoints in your code at points where you suspect issues or want to inspect variables.
- Step Through Code: Use the debugger to step through the code line by line, observing variable values and program flow.
- Inspect Variables: Examine the values of variables during runtime to identify unexpected or incorrect values.
- Watch Expressions: Set up watch expressions to monitor specific variables and expressions during debugging.

## 7.4 Logging and Output
Similarly, logging can also be a useful technique to output information about the program's execution. Use std::cout statements to print messages at different stages of the program, providing insights into the flow and identifying potential errors.

**Example:**
```md
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Program start" << std::endl;

    // Your code here

    std::cout << "Program end" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## 7.5 Compilation and Linking

A quick summary from chapter 6:

**Compilation** in C++ involves translating source code into machine-executable code. The compiler checks for syntax errors and generates object files (`.obj` or `.o`) with low-level instructions.

**Linking** combines object files and libraries into a single executable file. The linker resolves references between program parts, ensuring functions and variables are correctly connected.

### Detecting Compilation and Linking Errors

1. **Compilation Errors:**
   - Occur during code translation.
   - Common issues include syntax errors and undeclared variables.
   - Check compiler output for error messages and line numbers.

2. **Linking Errors:**
   - Arise when combining object files.
   - Common errors include undefined references.
   - Review linker messages for unresolved symbols.

### Using Compilation and Linking Output

1. **Compiler Output:**
   - Inspect for syntax errors and code-related issues.
   - Address errors indicated by line numbers in the source code.

2. **Linker Output:**
   - Review messages for unresolved symbols.
   - Ensure all necessary files are included in the linking command.

Understanding compilation and linking distinctions helps pinpoint errors in C++ code. Compiler messages reveal code-related issues, while linker messages expose problems with symbol resolution and connections between program parts.


## 7.6 External Libraries for Exception Handling
While not covered in detail in this handbook, there are external libraries in C++ that provide exception handling capabilities similar to Python. However, it's recommended for beginners to first understand the basics of C++ error handling before exploring these libraries.

In summary, error handling in C++ involves a combination of return codes, debugging techniques, logging, and, optionally, external libraries. Embrace the learning curve, leverage debugging tools, and gradually become proficient in identifying and resolving errors in your C++ code.
