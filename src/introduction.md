## 1. Syntax Differences
- Understand and navigate syntax disparities between Python and C++, including variable declaration, function definition, and overall code style.

## 2. Static Typing
- Grasp C++'s static typing approach, requiring explicit variable type declarations.
- Compare with Python's dynamic typing.

## 3. Memory Management
- Explore C++'s direct control over memory allocation and deallocation.
- Optional: Briefly touch on Rust's memory allocation approach for enhanced security.

## 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Learn fundamental OOP concepts in C++, including classes, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## 5. Standard Template Library (STL)
- Uncover the power of STL, C++'s standard library, and its pre-defined classes and functions for handling complex data structures and algorithms.stat

## 6. Error Handling ???
- Understand error handling in C++ without built-in exception support. ?
- Discover alternative methods such as return codes and statements. ?

## 7. Compilation and Linking
- Gain insights into the compilation and linking process in C++, contrasting it with Python's interpretation process.

## 8. DLL Files (Windows)
- Define DLL files and distinguish them from regular exe files in a Windows environment.

## 9. Compilation for Different CPU Architectures
- Explore the nuances of compiling programs for various CPU architectures.

## 10. Performance
- Acquire techniques for optimizing performance in C++ programs.
- Identify reasons why C++ often outperforms Python.

## 11. Different Ways of Doing Things
- Compare implementations of common tasks in both languages, offering best practices for each.

## 12. Cheat Sheet
- Compile a "C++ for Python Developers" cheat sheet, featuring commonly used codes with examples for functions, variables, and classes.
