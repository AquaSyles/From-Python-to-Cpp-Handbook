# From Python to C++

## Project Assignment for A.K. at F21 VGS Spring 2024 in the subject Concept Development and Programming, and Technology Understanding.

### Introduction

You are now facing the challenge of migrating from Python to C++. This assignment consists of two parts: a handbook providing a thorough understanding of C++ concepts.

#### Part 1: Handbook - From Python to C++

1. **Syntax Differences**
    - Describe the syntax differences between C++ and Python.
    - Familiarize yourself with variable declaration, function definition, and general code style in C++.
    - Also, briefly refer to the best code style in Python [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

2. **Static Typing**
    - In Python, you can declare a variable like `x = 10`. In C++, you must be more specific about the variable type to be declared. Explain the static typing approach in C++ and how to declare variable types upon creation.
    - Compare this with dynamic typing in Python.
    > Note: This does not refer to the "static" keyword in declaration but rather the principle that variable declaration must always have a type.

3. **Memory Management**
    - Explain how C++ provides direct control over memory allocation and deallocation.
    - Optional: Briefly explain how the new language Rust approaches memory allocation and why this is particularly important for security/buffer overflows.
    - Explore the use of pointers, references, and other memory management concepts.

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    - Describe fundamental OOP concepts such as classes, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism in C++.

5. **Standard Template Library (STL)**
    - Present STL as a powerful feature in C++, including pre-defined classes and functions.
    - Show how STL handles complex data structures and algorithms.

6. **Error Handling**
    - Discuss error handling methods in C++ without built-in support for exceptions.
    - Present alternative methods such as return codes and statements.

7. **Compilation and Linking**
    - Provide an overview of the compilation and linking process in C++.
    - Compare this with the interpretation process in Python.

8. **DLL Files (Windows)**
    - Define DLL files and explain their difference from regular exe files.

9. **Compilation for Different CPU Architectures**
    - Explore how to compile your program for different CPU architectures.

10. **Performance**
    - Learn techniques to optimize performance in C++ programs.
    - Identify why C++ often runs faster than Python.

11. **Different Ways of Doing Things**
    - Compare various implementations of common tasks such as print and string manipulation.
    - Explain best practices for each task.

12. **Cheat Sheet**
    - Create a "C++ for Python Developers" cheat sheet with the most commonly used codes.
    - Include examples for functions, variables, classes, etc.
